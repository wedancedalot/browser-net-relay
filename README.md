# BrowserNetRelay

Sometimes one (for some crazy reason) needs to establish a tcp connection or send udp messages directly from browser.
**BrowserNetRelay** is an attempt to circumvent the browsers inability to work with tcp and udp protocols. 

Start a simple node.js script and connect to it from the browser via WS. That's it. You can work with http/tcp/udp

### Features
- CORS-less http requests
- TCP server/client
- UDP socket listening/writing
